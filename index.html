            pandemic at around mid-January as cases were just increasing exponentially and death
            numbers just increased. It reached America in January of 2020. At first it was just a mild case,
            nobody really thought that it was any serious, until the diesease spread rapidly and until there
            were numerous death cases in the US, then the government took action. We are going to show the
