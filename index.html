                <p class="left">COVID-19 is an infectious disease that had it's first case in December of 2019. 
                It became a worldwide pandemic at around mid-January as case numbers started to increase. 
                It reached America in January of 2020. At first, it was just a mild case and nobody really 
                thought that it was any serious, until the disease spread rapidly and there
                were numerous death cases in the US. Then, the government took action. We are going to show the
                cases and deaths caused by COVID-19 overtime in the US alongside trends
                observed over the top 10 states with the most deaths and cases.</p>
