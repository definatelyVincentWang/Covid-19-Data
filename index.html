                <h2>So What is COVID-19?</h2>
                <p>COVID-19 is an infectious disease that had it's first case in December of 2019.<br>
                        It became a worldwide pandemic at around mid-January as case numbers started to increase. <br>
                        It reached America in January of 2020. At first, it was just a mild case and nobody really <br>
                        thought that it was any serious, until the disease spread rapidly and there were numerous <br>
                        death cases in the US. Then, the government took action. We are going to show the cases and <br>
                        deaths caused by COVID-19 overtime in the US alongside trends<br>
                        observed over the top 10 states with the most deaths and cases.</p>

                <h2>Our Results</h2>
                <p>After graphing our data, we determined that in the US, Total Deaths peaked in December <br>
                        We believe this is because of the travel season and that maybe, like the flu and common cold,
                        <br>
                        COVID-19 spreads easier in the cold. We then saw rapid decline of deaths coming into June,
                        however <br>
                        We also saw continued increases in COVID-19 cases. We believe the opposite trends of deaths and
                        cases <> is due to increased vaccination levels. We also saw an increased risk for getting
                                infected or dying >
