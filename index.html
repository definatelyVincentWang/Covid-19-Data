                <h2>So What is COVID-19?</h2>                
                <p class="left">COVID-19 is an infectious disease that had it's first case in December of 2019.<br> 
                It became a worldwide pandemic at around mid-January as case numbers started to increase. <br>
                It reached America in January of 2020. At first, it was just a mild case and nobody really <br>
                thought that it was any serious, until the disease spread rapidly and there were numerous <br>
                death cases in the US. Then, the government took action. We are going to show the cases and <br>
                deaths caused by COVID-19 overtime in the US alongside trends<br> 
                observed over the top 10 states with the most deaths and cases.</p>
                <h2>How do you use this website?</h2>
                <p class="left">This website has links to all different kinds of graphs. <br>
                Click on each link to get the data for the specified state/contry. Currently, <br>
                This website is in construction and only has data for 10 different states and <br>
                the entire US. We plan to add more states and other countries in the future.</p>

               <h2>Our Results</h2>
                <p>After graphing our data, we determined that in the US, Total Deaths peaked in December. <br>
                We believe this is because of the travel season and that maybe, like the flu and common cold, <br>
                COVID-19 spreads easier in the cold. We then saw rapid decline of deaths coming into June, however <br>
                We also saw continued increases in COVID-19 cases. We believe the decreased trends of deaths and cases <br>
                is due to increased vaccination levels. We also saw an increased risk for getting infected or dying from <br>
                covid-19 in Women over 85 years compared to men. However, we also saw an increased risk in Men from <br>
                75-84 compared to women.</p>

                <h2>About our program:</h2>
                <p>So, we used two different python files: state.py and make_fig.py. In the state.py, we used the cgi module <br>
                to take in a string input. Like US, California, New_York, etc. Using this as well as fstrings, we would be able to use <br>
                minimal code for all of the websites, since they all used the same exact code. We also found that you can “run” a python <br>
                script using<img src=””> in html, as shown here: (Show stuff). This calls the make_fig python script. In make_fig.py, we <br>
                used the matplotlib library to graph all of the data. We used the csv module to convert all of our csv data into python dictionaries. <br>
                We also imported sys in order to “print” the matplotlib figure. We also imported the cgi module to take in an “input” to save code. <br>
                We have a function that uses matplotlib to draw a line graph (point to line). We also have a function to graph bar graphs using matplotlib. <br>
                We have 2 functions for unpacking data. At the bottom, we have a bunch of if statements to check which state the “input” is, and print the proper graphs. <br>
